#GitHub Repository Structure
This file outlines the structure and organization of the SEIR Model Parameter Identifiability Analysis repository.


#Overview
This repository contains the code and analysis for demonstrating parameter identifiability in SEIR epidemic models, with a specific focus on comparing homogeneous and heterogeneous models fitted to single and dual epidemic scenarios.
